# TimeSeries_Forecasting

In this project, we try to forecast the daily peak electricity load for specific zone of New York city, called Genese. We extract the required explanatory dataset by NYISO.

In the first part of the project, We explore the hourly demand dataset, evaluate na√Øve methods, and establish explanatory variables leading to peak demands. 

In the second part, we continue with the evaluation of the smoothing methods and regression methods.

In the last phase of the project, we applied SARIMA and ARX models to the data. We then did overall comparisons and selected a winner to predict on our test set. In this final part, we finally conclude our analysis on the NYISO electricity demand.
